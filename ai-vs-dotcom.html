<p>It seems like most people agree that LLMs are in a bubble. The amount
of money that LLMs would need to generate to make good on their
valuations is more than the GDP of a mid sized country. The environmental
impact of success would likely cause mass extinction.</p>

<ul>
  <li>networks transmit information, LLM generate media. We have been drowning in media since before
LLMs. Any extra media is marginal.</li>
  <li>
    <p>networks are composed of many different parts that can be upgraded and replaced.
GPUs are single units. Once a GPU burns out the whole value is lost. There is not a long
term value to a GPU bought today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Modern society needs more truth and correctness, LLM gives us truthiness.</li>
</ul>
