<p>People need analogies to help understand how software development happens but
all analogies are at some level inaccurate. For example, people talk about
software as a craft, but this falls down because a craftsman creates a product
that has value, while software engineers create code and the business does not
sell the code as a product. I have also heard of software as gardening.
Sometimes it feels like MBAs view software development as an assembly line,
again with code as the product.</p>

<p>So, here is how to analogize software engineering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The product the business sells is data delivered to the user.</li>
  <li>The workers that make the product are the computers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where does that leave software engineers? Software engineers are middle
management. At the most debased, we merely translate directives from above into
computer language. At the most pure, a team controls their service and ensures
it is aligned with broaders goals.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I like to imagine it is similar to a factory. The software team
is responsible for creating the instructions for the computer-workers,
monitoring inputs and outputs, ensuring the data-product meets organizational
quality standards, etc.</p>
