<p>I have been in software for 15 years and given the current insanity, who knows
how much longer it will be before we are all forced into the phone factories.
So, here is a bit of a software engineering retrospective as an open letter to
developers, leadership, executives, and board members.</p>

<h2 id="the-field-of-software-engineering-is-filthy">The field of software engineering is filthy</h2>

<p>A little over a hundred years ago we discovered germs. Scientists found
microscopic life living everywhere and shortly those small life forms began to
get connected to macroscopic effects. Some doctors and nurses began to take
notice of the new theory and began advocating for the washing of hands prior to
dealing with patients. Those enterprising doctors and nurses were treated with
scorn by older doctors well after science proved the effects of that
microscopic life. As the morbid saying goes <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/science-really-does-advance-one-funeral-at-a-time-study-suggests/3010961.article">“Science advances one funeral at a
time”</a>, and only as the old guard passed the torch did hand washing gain
widespread acceptance as a necessity.</p>

<h2 id="software-does-not-wash-its-hands">Software does not wash its hands</h2>

<p>The cause and effect between a surgery and a patient dying of dysentary was
just far enough apart that the link could be denied. Only through emperical
study could a light be shone. Likewise, a software project dies slowly
enough that people will deny cause and effect. Software engineers serve as
disease vectors, spreading the contagion project to project, never staying
anywhere long enough to see their failures. An army of Typhoid Marys.</p>

<h2 id="an-open-wound">An open wound</h2>

<p>Bad patterns appear and reproduce. Bugs proliferate. Broken domain models force
broken designs. There is no silver bullet to the problems, so we are compelled
to ignore them by others. We normalize the problem. We watch bugfixes go from
taking a few minutes to taking a few days to taking weeks, but many of us
assume that that is inevitable. Most engineers have never worked on software
that isn’t thoroughly compromised by problems. Like doctors of old, we start to
believe disease and death and are a normal part of our work.</p>

<h2 id="a-culture-of-slow-failure">A culture of slow failure</h2>

<p>Rewards and recognition are given to teams whose projects are breaking weekly.
Long hours of firefighting gets commendations when they should get condemnations.
Everyone is compelled to cut corners and to throw best practices under the bus
in the name of pragmatism. Discussions are halted on the first half baked idea
that comes up. Those brought up in “don’t wash your hands” culture seek to
re-implement that culture at new jobs.</p>

<h2 id="an-ounce-of-prevention-is-worth-a-pound-of-cure">An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure</h2>

<p>A doctor washing their hands prevents the diseases living on their hands from
spreading. A software developer must practice mental hygene. A software
developer must practice code hygene. Understand what patterns are easier to
change. Consistently refactor to good patterns as early as possible. Fix
domain model issues before they spread chaos.</p>

<p>We can make a better software. We can stop so much pain and suffering. Learn
how to write testable code patterns. Learn how to write cheap and effective
test suites.</p>
