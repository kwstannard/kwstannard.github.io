But, sometimes you have tasks that need to be performed only on repositories that
your team owns. There are many ways to route a packet, but I settled on using
symlinks and directories.</p><p>I created a directory ~/team and added symlinks for my team repos to the repo.
So, the team directory looked something like this:</p><code><pre>team/core -> ../work/core
team/users -> ../work/users
team/payments -> ../work/payments</pre></code><p>During my job search I have been putting perspective job notes into files. Then
I realized I needed a quick way to know what jobs were still active. So, I
created a ./current directory and added symlinks to the note files there.</p><code><pre>current/meta -> ../meta.txt
current/apple -> ../apple.txt
current/37signals -> ../37signals.txt</pre></code><p>Why is this nicer than some other organizational method? I like the way it allows
quick access to a specific thing like a repo directory or a file. I don't need to
think about a format because the format is the file system. In Ruby terms, it is
kind of like a hash stored in a variable. The variable is the directory name and
the value is the destination of the symlink.</p></body>
