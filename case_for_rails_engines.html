Often a company starts with a monolith and after a few years the initial
designs start hindering further development. Eventually splitting the
monolith into distributed services is suggested enough times that it
happens. Shortly after that the distributed service design also starts to
grate, but now the barrier to change is so high that teams running other
services might as well be a different company.</p><p>Distributed services calcify the design. We need to test and iterate the
design prior to deploying a distributed service. The Rails ecosystem
provides tools to do this.</p><h2>Start of a solution</h2><p>Computers are very good at simulating other computers. What would be
helpful is to have a series of defined steps between a monolithic app and
distributed service. You could quickly iron out issues prior to jumping
into the muck of distributed services.</p><p>Starting from a monolith, the next step is some form of in-application
organization framework. There are a few options here, but given that we are using
Rails and the general dircetion I suggest using a Rails Engine for reasons
you can see later.</p><p>To make this more concrete, lets imagine that we are starting from a
monolithic ToDo Rails app and we want to break out the
Authentication and Authorization domain out from the mess. We will make
a modules directory and create a new Engine inside it called Auth.</p><h2>The 4 stages of isolation</h2><h4>Stage one - Isolating code</h4><p>Start by moving the auth code into Auth engine. As you do this, isolate the
code behind an API. Work to reduce the size and scope of the API.</p><h4>Stage two - Isolating the data</h4><p>You may want to increase the isolation even more. Create a database and have
the Auth engine connect to it. The engine allows you to find and squash
any areas of the ToDo app that are still reaching past the engine interface
to the database interface.</p><h4>Stage three - Adding an HTTP interface</h4><p>Ruby's WebMock gem allows you to selectively intercept HTTP requests and
route them to an arbitrary Rack interface. Coincidentally, Rails Engines
are Rack interfaces. What this allows is for you to smoothly transition
one API call at a time from code to HTTP calls. You may want to introduce
artificial lag or other network conditions to see how the system
responds.</p><p>You might wonder why this is listed as a stopping point. This is a valid
state for both development and test environments as it lets you run the
Auth service without needing an actual remote deployment. In my experience
this has always been a massive problem with remote services, requiring
intense discussion and coordination to accomplish. But, by putting the
remote service in a Rails engine, you can get this for much cheaper.</p><h4>Stage four - Deploying a remote service</h4><p>You run a new application and load the Auth service in it. Then in the
ToDo app, start routing more and more Auth requests from the internal
Auth service to the remote Auth service while monitoring the transition,
until eventually all traffic is going to the remote service.</p><p>Congratulations, you now have transitioned a service to fully remote
while giving yourself lots of ability to see problems before they become
nigh impossible to fix.</p><h2>Postscript - The ActiveRecord::Base problem</h2><p>The data separation step is more difficult than it needs to be because
ActiveRecord::Base hard references are the cause of weird things like
needing to "install" engine db migrations and needing to tell the containing
application about how to connect to the engine database. This is hackable with
some clever monkey patches, but it would be preferable if engines could be fully
self contained out of the box and set themselves up with the Railties system.</p></body>
