# LLM vs Dotcom Bubbles

It seems like most people agree that LLMs are in a bubble. The amount
of money that LLMs would need to generate to make good on their
valuations is more than the GDP of a mid sized country. The environmental
impact of success would likely cause mass extinction.

# Infrastructure

- networks transmit information, LLM generate media. We have been drowning in media since before
LLMs. Any extra media is marginal.
- networks are composed of many different parts that can be upgraded and replaced.
  GPUs are single units. Once a GPU burns out the whole value is lost. There is not a long
  term value to a GPU bought today.

- Modern society needs more truth and correctness, LLM gives us truthiness.
