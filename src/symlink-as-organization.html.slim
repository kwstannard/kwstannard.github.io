  h1 Symlink as an Organizational Tool

  p
    |
      At most jobs you have many repositories. I like to clone them under ~/work.
      But, sometimes you have tasks that need to be performed only on repositories that
      your team owns. There are many ways to route a packet, but I settled on using
      symlinks and directories.

      I created a directory ~/team and added symlinks for my team repos to the repo.
      So, the team directory looked something like this:

  code
    pre
      |
        team/core -> ../work/core
        team/users -> ../work/users
        team/payments -> ../work/payments

      During my job search I have been putting perspective job notes into files. Then
      I realized I needed a quick way to know what jobs were still active. So, I
      created a ./current directory and added symlinks to the note files there.

  code
    pre
      |
        current/meta -> ../meta.txt
        current/apple -> ../apple.txt
        current/37signals -> ../37signals.txt

      Why is this nicer than some other organizational method? I like the way it allows
      quick access to a specific thing like a repo directory or a file. I don't need to
      think about a format because the format is the file system. In Ruby terms, it is
      kind of like a hash stored in a variable. The variable is the directory name and
      the value is the destination of the symlink.
