to perform your profession in the hands of a tech company who only cares about
quarterly numbers. I think it is analogous to another historical situation.</p><p>For most of human history, farming took an incredible amount of manpower.
One family could not easily become wealthy from farming. So, budding
aristocrats with a lot of land needed a way to produce from as much of their
land as possible to raise money.</p><p>These days, tech barons are competing on a digital land grab. LLMs and
agents running on vast tracts of GPU farms are the name of the game. But,
one company can only prompt an LLM so many times and they need to make money
off of this digital land.</p><p>The old aristocrats and land holders solved their problem by renting out
their land to peasants who had none and needed to make a living. The peasants
worked the land and produced goods and they paid the land lord for the
privilege.</p><p>The tech barons rent out their digital land to the white collar workers. The
workers produce documents by utilizing the LLMs and in return pay rent to the
tech barons.</p><p>The peasants become familiar with and connected to their rented land. The
white collar worker becomes familiar with and connected to their LLM agents.</p><p>The lords now start turning the screws. The enshittification of farming
commences. Rents increase. Contract terms change. The peasants complain. They
can no longer afford rights to work the land. The lords don't care about
anything except the next rent collections.</p><p>Where else is the peasant to go? They know the land. Leaving is costly.
They have a community on and around that rented land.</p><p>Where else is the white collar worker to go? They have spent years on the
ins and outs of their LLM of choice. They formed parasocial bond with it and
with the community around the LLM.</p><p>In conclusion, I think the safest place to be right now is utilizing free and
open source tools. The best way to ensure that my labor is fully portable and
secure on a longer term horizon is to not let myself be tied to the whims of
an increasingly desperate tech corporation. The days of easy growth are long
gone and the enshittification will continue to accellerate within the paid
tools space.</p></body>
